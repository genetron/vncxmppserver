	* winvnc/: vncMenu.cpp, vncProperties.cpp, vncProperties.h: In
	certain cases we do not want to remember or restore current tab
	selection in the Properties dialog. In particular, tab selection is

2006-08-05 13:19  const_k

	* winvnc/vncDesktop.cpp: Disabling mirror driver support under NT4
	completely. Driver support was broken under NT4, it detected the
	driver and "used" it even if it was not installed. Thus, updates
	were not detected properly.

2006-08-05 12:12  const_k

	* winvnc/: vncClient.cpp, vncClient.h: Reverted changes to
	vncClient::m_inputblocked incremental semantics introduced in a

	* winvnc/: WinVNC.cpp, WinVNC.h, vncMenu.cpp, vncMenu.h,
	vncService.cpp, vncService.h: New -shareall and -shareprimary
	command-line options have been implemented.  They work similar to
	-sharewindow but do not require arguments. These options do not
	start WinVNC - they control already running WinVNC instance
	instead.  These modification also introduce the -sharearea option,
	but it's not fully functional at the moment.

	vncProperties.cpp, vncProperties.h: Improved and simplified the
	SharedDesktopArea class, removed related stuff from the Properties

	and only on pressing Apply or Ok. Previously, the changes in the
	Display tab of the Properties dialog were applied immediately and
	remained active even on pressing Cancel. Obviously, that was
	incorrect.

	showing a message box instead of the usage help message.

2003-07-11 18:17  const_k

	* vncviewer/: AboutBox.cpp, AboutBox.h, VNCOptions.cpp,
	VNCOptions.h, res/vncviewer.rc: Improved the layout of the dialog
	box with the usage help. Now the same dialog appears both on
	specifying the /? option, or on specifying an incorrect host name.

2003-07-11 05:14  const_k

	* winvnc/vncDesktop.cpp: Closing HKEY_CURRENT_USER properly on

	authenticated against a view-only password.

2003-07-10 19:03  const_k

	* winvnc/vncClient.cpp: Writing into the log on receiving an

	improvements in the File Transfer dialog.

2003-07-10 18:08  const_k

	uploads/downloads.

2003-07-10 18:01  const_k

	directory handles in file transfers.

2003-07-10 17:57  const_k

2003-07-10 17:51  const_k

	* winvnc/vncBuffer.h: Unused function prototype has been removed.

2003-07-05 00:53  const_k

	* winvnc/: WinVNC.rc, resource.h, vncDesktop.cpp, vncDesktop.h,
	vncProperties.cpp, vncProperties.h, vncServer.cpp, vncServer.h:
	Implemented a possibility to turn off hooking via VNCHooks.dll when
	full screen polling is in use, and added a corresponding option to
	the Properties dialog (that is Advanced Properties in the
	HorizonLive configuration).

2003-07-02 00:19  const_k

	* winvnc/: WinVNC.cpp, WinVNC.h: Fixed a number of minor problems
	with -connect and -sharewindow options. Added the possibility to
	use the -connect option without arguments, to bring up the "Add New
	Client" dialog.

2003-07-02 00:14  const_k

	* winvnc/WinVNC.cpp: Implemented a possibility to specify
	-sharewindow argument without quotes, and fixed a problem with not
	counting the last character of that argument.

2003-07-02 00:11  const_k

	* winvnc/: vncService.cpp, vncService.h: Fixed broken
	case-insensitive comparison, and the problem with restoring windows
	that were maximized. Also, general code improvements were made.

2003-07-01 23:57  const_k

	* winvnc/: WinVNC.rc, vncProperties.cpp: Removed the code that
	searched a window by comparing window titles with the substrings
	entered in window selection edit controls. The code was broken in
	two ways -- it did not respect actual sharing mode (window, full
	desktop or screen area), and it tried to find a window even if one
	was already selected using the target icon (in the latter case, the
	string in the edit control was not always a valid window title).
	Also, window selection edit controls in both HorizonLive and public
	configurations have been made read-only.

2003-07-01 23:49  const_k

	* winvnc/vncService.cpp: Showing an error message in cases when the
	window with a specified title is not found, for the -sharewindow
	option. This is a patch from Oleg Sheikin.

2003-06-25 23:35  const_k

	* vncviewer/VNCOptions.cpp: Now the usage help message lists nearly
	all the supported options.

2003-06-25 23:31  const_k

	* winvnc/WinVNC.h: Improved output of the WinVNC -help option.

2003-06-25 20:53  const_k

	* winvnc/vncClient.cpp: Fixed the CopyRect handling that was
	completely broken. Basically, the code from the version 1.2.8 has
	been copied, with minor changes to respect variable framebuffer
	size.

2003-06-25 20:49  const_k

	* vncviewer/.cvsignore, vncviewer/ClientConnection.cpp,
	vncviewer/Makefile.bcc32, vncviewer/SessionDialog.cpp,

	The code ported to the Borland C++ compiler.

2003-06-25 20:46  const_k

	* vncviewer/ClientConnection.cpp: Fixed a bug with incorrect
	deletion of FileTransfer objects.

2003-06-25 20:43  const_k

	* winvnc/WinVNC.cpp: Solved a problem with parsing command line
	option names. Older versions would treat -killANYTHING as -kill,
	and that could cause problems if options like -killallclients were
	misspeled. Now only -kill and -killallclients will work,
	-killsomething will result showing the help message.

2003-06-25 20:40  const_k

	* winvnc/: WinVNC.cpp, WinVNC.h, vncMenu.cpp, vncMenu.h,
	vncService.cpp, vncService.h: Implemented new -killallclients

	for the "-sharewindow" option implementation, from Oleg Sheikin.

2003-06-15 02:02  const_k

	* vncviewer/: ClientConnection.cpp, Daemon.cpp, SessionDialog.cpp,
	VNCOptions.cpp, VNCOptions.h: Minor code improvements from Oleg
	Sheikin.

2003-06-15 01:59  const_k

	* winvnc/: WinVNC.cpp, WinVNC.h, vncMenu.cpp, vncMenu.h,
	vncProperties.cpp, vncService.cpp, vncService.h: Implemented new
	"-sharewindow" command-line option in WinVNC. It allows identifying
	a window to share, by specifying a substring of its title. Similar
	function is added in the Properties dialog. This is a patch from
	Oleg Sheikin.

2003-06-05 02:51  const_k

	* winvnc/: WinVNC.rc, vncClient.cpp, vncDesktop.cpp: A set of minor

	minor change in a text message, and one bugfix.

2003-06-05 02:47  const_k

	* winvnc/: WinVNC.dsp, WinVNC.rc: Now the Java classes will not be
	included in the HorizonLive configuration.

2003-06-05 02:43  const_k

	* winvnc/vncProperties.cpp: Restored the code closing the HKCU
	registry hive. This code was removed to workaround a password reset
	problem, but had introduced another issue that can be considered
	even worse. Now we should find other ways to fix old password reset
	problem.

2003-05-29 13:33  const_k

	* vncviewer/: ClientConnection.cpp, Daemon.cpp, SessionDialog.cpp,
	VNCOptions.cpp, VNCOptions.h: Chosen more appropriate names for the
	registry settings.

	* vncviewer/: ClientConnection.cpp, VNCOptions.cpp, VNCOptions.h:
	Added the code to handle the "Small dot cursor" radio button, and

	changing the local cursor shape now has immediate effect in all
	windows.

2003-05-20 23:30  const_k

	* vncviewer/: VNCOptions.cpp, VNCOptions.h, res/vncviewer.rc: Added

2003-03-23 02:14  const_k

	* vncviewer/ClientConnection.cpp: Fixed a bug with writing to the
	memory beyond the declared array size.	This bug caused strange
	effects like strlen("") returning 1 :-) thus preventing file
	transfer interface from working correctly.

2003-03-23 02:11  const_k

	* winvnc/vncClient.cpp: Fixed a bug - the code did not check the
	return value properly after calling FindFirstFile(). This bug
	crashed the server after a client requested the file list for a
	non-existing path.

2003-03-23 02:07  const_k

	VNCOptions.cpp, VNCOptions.h, vncviewer.cpp, vncviewer.dsp,
	vncviewer.h, res/resource.h, res/vncviewer.rc: The "Connection
	Options" dialog has been converted from a Property Sheet based
	solution to a modal dialog window with the Tab Control element.
	This solves the problem of double pressing the F1 key. The code has
	been transformed into a separate class, VNCHelp. This is a set of
	changes by Oleg Sheikin.

2003-03-06 13:47  const_k

	* vncviewer/: libjpeg/libjpeg.dsp, zlib/zlib.dsp: MS-DOS style line

	system and tray menus of the vncviewer.

2003-02-27 01:33  const_k

	* vncviewer/ClientConnection.cpp, winvnc/vncClient.cpp: Added
	message type negotiation -- now all the protocol messages used in
	file transfers are properly advertised by the server. The client
	enables file transfers only if it knows they are supported by the
	server.

2003-02-26 17:36  const_k

	* rfb/rfbproto.h: Leading tabs replaced with spaces, to make the

	* rfb/rfbproto.h, vncviewer/ClientConnection.cpp,
	vncviewer/ClientConnection.h, winvnc/vncClient.cpp: Protocol
	version 3.130 has been changed once again. Now the server informs
	the client about all supported encodings, besides "raw". The client
	can use this information to choose which encodings to request
	(although current viewer does not try to be that smart).

2003-02-25 20:28  const_k

	* vncviewer/ClientConnection.cpp, winvnc/vncClient.cpp,
	winvnc/vncClient.h: Both the server and the viewer were made
	interoperable with the RFB protocol 3.3 used in the standard
	VNC/RealVNC and in TightVNC 1.2.x versions.

2003-02-25 20:25  const_k

	* vncviewer/: CapsContainer.cpp, CapsContainer.h,
	ClientConnection.cpp, ClientConnection.h, vncviewer.dsp: New
	CapsContainer class has been implemented. It is used to keep lists
	of protocol features (capabilities) advertised by the server in
	protocol version 3.130. The ClientConnection class maintains four
	capability lists: tunneling methods, authentication schemes,
	server->client protocol messages, and client->server messages.

2003-02-25 02:43  const_k

	* rfb/rfbproto.h, winvnc/vncClient.cpp: A typo fixed, and a

	* rfb/rfbproto.h, vncviewer/rfb.h, vncviewer/vncviewer.dsp,
	winvnc/WinVNC.dsp, winvnc/rfb.h: The rfbproto.h file from both
	winvnc/ and vncviewer/ has been moved to the new rfb/ directory, to
	have just one copy instead of two.

2003-02-23 12:44  const_k

	* winvnc/: vncClient.h, vncServer.cpp, vncServer.h: Unused code has
	been removed -- m_capability and m_teleport fields in the vncClient
	class, and corresponding functions in both vncClient and vncServer.

2003-02-23 12:35  const_k

	* winvnc/.cvsignore: Ignoring WinVNC.log.bak as well.

2003-02-23 00:31  const_k

	* vncviewer/ClientConnection.cpp, vncviewer/ClientConnection.h,
	winvnc/vncClient.cpp: The protocol has been changed, the protocol
	version is now 3.130.  Protocol modification make it possible to
	negotiate "tunneling" (e.g.  encryption) methods, authentication
	types and additional protocol messages. This version of the
	protocol is incompatible with 3.3, compatibility issues should be
	solved in the next commit.

2003-02-23 00:28  const_k

	* winvnc/.cvsignore: Ignoring WinVNC.log.

2003-02-23 00:25  const_k

	* vncviewer/: ClientConnection.cpp, ClientConnection.h: Reverted
	from the protocol version 3.5 back to 3.3 in the viewer.  Also,
	removed the "inline" modifier from the
	ClientConnection::ReadExact() function.

2003-02-19 14:40  const_k

	* winvnc/vncProperties.cpp: A quick fix for the problem with
	"QuerySetting" and "QueryTimeout" options -- they could be copied
	from user to default settings without user's intention.

2003-02-19 14:39  const_k

	* vncviewer/VNCOptions.cpp: Removed an extra line causing a

	winvnc/VNCHooks/.cvsignore, winvnc/libjpeg/.cvsignore,
	winvnc/zlib/.cvsignore: Added .cvsignore files, to make CVS ignore
	library and temporary files.

2003-02-19 14:16  const_k

	branch BRANCH_1_2_STABLE.

2003-02-07 15:42  const_k

	* vncviewer/VNCOptions.cpp: Don't try to show a context help window

	positions for compression and JPEG quality levels.

2003-02-07 15:11  const_k

	* vncviewer/: ClientConnectionFullScreen.cpp, VNCOptions.cpp: The
	values of the VNCOptions::m_skipprompt variable were made
	correspond to its name; a patch from Oleg Sheikin.

2003-02-06 05:00  const_k

	* winvnc/: vncAcceptDialog.cpp, vncClient.cpp: Major bugfix --
	handling of the QueryAllowNoPass option was seriously broken. In
	addition to solving this issue, this patch re-organizes and fixes
	the InitAuthenticate() function in several more ways. E.g. the
	order of checks is now different -- first it checks for disabled
	empty passwords and loopback connections, then it checks AuthHosts
	settings and shows the query dialog, and only after that it
	requests authentication if necessary. Now the InitAuthenticate()
	function is much more mature and its code is much more readable.

2003-02-06 04:25  const_k

	changes also should fix the problem with Borland C++ compilation
	resulting vncviewer crashes after closing one connection and
	opening another one, e.g. in the listen mode.

2001-08-09 17:48  const

	* winvnc/vncDesktop.cpp: DrawIconEx flags corrected, now custom
	cursors can be shown properly under both WinNT and Win95/Win98,
	regardless of settings related to local cursor support.

2001-08-05 19:37  const

2001-08-05 19:34  const

	* winvnc/WinVNC.rc: DS_SETFOREGROUND flags removed -- not
	understood by Borland C++ 5.5.

	vncDesktop.cpp, vncDesktop.h, vncEncoder.cpp, vncEncoder.h,
	vncService.cpp: RichCursor encoding is now fully supported. Code
	implementing cursor shape updates has been reorganized, large parts
	were rewritten; this should be the final version of the "local
	cursor" feature. Besides that, code cleanups in many places.

2001-07-18 23:26  const

	* vncviewer/ClientConnectionCursor.cpp: Bug fixed: vncviewer used
	to set cursor hotspot incorrectly on XCursor and RichCursor
	updates.

2001-03-13 18:52  const

	* vncviewer/ClientConnectionCursor.cpp: Bugfix: local cursor
	implementation allocated DC and bitmap on each cursor movement but
	failed to free these recources. On Win95/98, after GDI resources
	were exhausted, mouse movement leaved cursor trails on the screen.
	Current fix allocates DC and bitmap only on cursor shape updates
	and disposes them properly.

2001-03-13 18:44  const

	* build-bcc32.bat, vncviewer/omnithread/build-bcc32.bat,
	vncviewer/res/build-bcc32.bat, winvnc/Makefile.bcc32,

	winvnc/omnithread/build-bcc32.bat: More porting to Borland C++ 5.5
	compiler. Now build scripts and makefiles should work in Win95/98
	environment.

2001-03-12 00:13  const

	* winvnc/: vncClient.cpp, vncClient.h: Started work to implement
	cursor shape updates for every possible cursor shape. At this
	moment, a skeleton for new implementation has been prepared, the
	code has been re-organized, but basic functionality has remained
	the same.

2001-03-12 00:05  const

	* vncviewer/Log.cpp, winvnc/Log.cpp: CORE SDI fixes applied to fix
	buffer overflows reported 2001-01-29.

2001-03-11 01:41  const

	* winvnc/vncDesktop.cpp: The color depth is set to correct value in
	24-bit truecolor mode.	Original WinVNC always used to set depth =
	bitsPerPixel. This change notably improves performance of the Tight
	encoder in both compression ratios and encoding/decoding speed.

2001-03-11 01:35  const

	* winvnc/vncEncodeTight.cpp: The "gradient" filter enabled again.

	changed to "vnclog".

2001-03-10 23:06  const

	* vncviewer/ClientConnectionTight.cpp: Bugfix: "gradient" filter
	was broken in non-24-bit color depths.

2001-03-10 23:05  const

	* vncviewer/VNCOptions.cpp: Default preferred encoding is now
	Tight.

2001-03-10 23:05  const

	* vncviewer/res/vncviewer.rc: Two version info blocks merged into
	one record.

2001-03-08 00:30  const

	* winvnc/tabletranstemplate.cpp: Workaround for buggy Borland C++
	5.5 compiler: pixel format translations from 24-bit colors worked
	incorrectly when optimizations were enabled.

2001-03-07 14:03  const

	* vncviewer/: ClientConnection.cpp, ClientConnection.h,
	ClientConnectionCursor.cpp: "Local cursor" implementation now works
	with scaling.

2001-03-07 13:56  const

	* winvnc/: vncEncodeTight.cpp, vncEncodeTight.h: Changes from
	current Unix version ported to Win32 code.  Minor formatting
	changes and code clean-ups.

2001-03-06 01:00  const

	* winvnc/vncEncodeTight.cpp: JPEG encoder worked incorrectly in
	16bpp mode (bug found by Martin Granell).

2001-03-06 00:03  const

	* vncviewer/ClientConnectionTight.cpp: Minor clean-ups and tiny

	Proper cooperation between threads in "local cursor" code.  Correct
	loading of configuration files where "compresslevel" or "quality"
	setting were not set.  Corrected path to libjpeg library in the
	vncviewer.dsw.	Minor code clean-ups.
