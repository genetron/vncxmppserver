  </ul>
  <a name="inst"></a>
  <h3>Installation</h3>
  <p>
    TightVNC is available in the self-installing form. Just run the executable to perform the
    installation. You will see a familiar installation wizard which will allow you to read the
    license, choose the installation directory, choose a name for the TightVNC group under the
    Start-&gt;Programs menu etc.
  </p>
  <p>
    After running the setup program, a new &quot;TightVNC&quot; section will appear in the
    Start-&gt;Programs menu. If you would like to have TightVNC start automatically and run even
    if there is no active user, you should install it as a service using the corresponding menu
    item from the TightVNC Administration section. Note that installing the WinVNC service is the
    only way to make Ctrl-Alt-Del work remotely (applicable only to Windows NT/2000/XP systems).
  </p>
  <p>
    TightVNC defaults to install to the <tt>Program Files\TightVNC</tt> directory, but you can
    choose any other location during the installation. Note that TightVNC does not install
    anything in the system directory so an alternative way to install TightVNC is to just copy
    the executable and DLL files into any directory you like (but in this case you'll have
    to create shortcuts to the programs yourself).
  </p>
  <p>
    If you want to install TightVNC on a number of computers, and do not want to repeatedly enter
    the same password on each machine, install TightVNC once and set the password, then copy the
    registry settings under <tt>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\ORL\WinVNC3</tt> to other machines.
  </p>
  <p>
    The TightVNC installer can work in silent mode and not ask questions during installation (but
    it's possible that it might show message boxes if there are any errors). In this mode
    TightVNC will be installed into the default directory, that is, the <tt>TightVNC</tt>
    subdirectory in the <tt>Program Files</tt>). Here is the command line to install TightVNC in
    silent mode:
    <pre>
tightvnc-1.2.9-setup.exe /sp- /verysilent</pre>
  <a name="upgr"></a>
  <h3>Remote Upgrade</h3>
  </p>
  <p>
    TightVNC servers can be upgraded remotely. This means that you can perform the TightVNC
    installation working in an active TightVNC session. While the TightVNC service is running,
    it's impossible to replace its executable files in place, so the installer will copy new
    files into a temporary location, and these new files will replace older versions during the
    next reboot. The installer will prompt for reboot if it was not able to replace the
    executables.
  </p>
  <p>
    Before using this feature, you should read and understand the following:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Remote upgrade requires rebooting the computer. If you want to be able to access
      your computer after the reboot, make sure you're running WinVNC as a service,
      not in the application mode.</li>
    <li>If you're running WinVNC service from some another VNC distribution, this
      installation procedure won't replace it with the TightVNC service by default. 
      This is a limitation that may be solved in future versions. However, there is a way
      to perform such an upgrade: install TightVNC into the same directory where old VNC
      files (<tt>WinVNC.exe</tt> and <tt>VNCHooks.dll</tt>) are installed. In this case,
      old binaries will be replaced by the new ones during the reboot, and there will be no
      need to re-install the service. Please note that the installer should show you the
      reboot prompt at the end of the installation, otherwise you probably selected wrong
      installation directory.</li>
    <li>There is a number of things that can prevent the machine to reboot correctly, and
      that can cause losing the control over the computer. In other words, there is NO
      WARRANTY that the remote upgrade procedure is absolutely reliable. To minimize
      possible risks, close all the running applications (besides the WinVNC service
      itself) before launching the TightVNC installer.</li>
  </ul>
  <a name="start"></a>
  <h3>Getting Started</h3>
  <p>
    TightVNC, like normal VNC, has two parts: the server (WinVNC), which shares the screen of
    the machine it's running on, and the viewer which shows the remote screen received
    from the server. So to get started, you need to run a server on the machine you want to
    access remotely, and connect to it with a viewer. TightVNC Win32 distribution includes
    both the server and viewer parts.
  </p>
  <a name="start_serv"></a>
  <h4><font color="#007000">Running a Server (WinVNC)</font></h4>
  <p>
    WinVNC can be running in two ways: in the application mode and as a Windows service. In
    the application mode, the server can be running only during the current user session, and
    will close on the logout. To start WinVNC in the application mode, choose the shortcut
    <b>Programs-&gt;TightVNC-&gt;Launch TightVNC Server</b> from the Start menu.
  </p>
  <p>
    To make a machine accessible even if there is no user logged in, and to make the server
    start automatically after reboot, the TightVNC server should be running as a Windows
    service. To install WinVNC service, choose
    <b>Programs-&gt;TightVNC-&gt;Administration-&gt;Install VNC Service</b>. In Windows
    95/98/ME that will start the service immediately, while in Windows NT/2000/XP you'll
    have to start the service manually using the Services item in the Control Panel (or it
    will be started automatically on the next system reboot). Note that if the VNC service
    was started manually, you may have to run
    <b>Programs-&gt;TightVNC-&gt;Administration-&gt;Run Service Helper</b>, to make WinVNC
    display its tray icon (see below).
  </p>
  <p>
    Regardless of the way WinVNC was started, it will show the Properties window on the first
    startup, to let you enter the password you will use in the viewer to access the machine. 
    In default configuration, each user can have his own separate WinVNC password, and there
    is a special default password which should be used when nobody is logged in on the server
    machine. To set the user password, just access the Properties dialog the usual way, as
    described below. However, to set the default password, you will have to run
    <b>Programs-&gt;TightVNC-&gt;Administration-&gt;Show Default Settings</b>.
  </p>
  <p>
    On successful startup, TightVNC will add a small icon to the tray in the system task bar.
    The icon has white background if there is no viewers connected, and inverted colors when
    at least one viewer accesses the desktop. Moving the mouse over this icon shows the IP
    address of the machine (which can be entered in the remote viewer to access the server).
  </p>
  <table border="0" align="center" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="8">
    <tr align="center">
      <td nowrap><img src="images/winvnc-icon-normal.png" width="162" height="59" hspace="18"
        vspace="4" alt="[WinVNC tray icon]"><br><font size="-1"><i>A normal icon of the<br>TightVNC
        server</i></font></td>
      <td nowrap><img src="images/winvnc-icon-ip.png" width="162" height="59" hspace="18"
        vspace="4" alt="[WinVNC tray icon]"><br><font size="-1"><i>Mouse over the icon<br>shows IP
        addresses</i></font></td>
    </tr>
    <tr align="center">
      <td nowrap><img src="images/winvnc-icon-connected.png" width="162" height="59" hspace="18"
        vspace="4" alt="[WinVNC tray icon]"><br><font size="-1"><i>Inverted colors when<br>a viewer is
        connected</i></font></td>
      <td nowrap><img src="images/winvnc-icon-disabled.png" width="162" height="59" hspace="18"
        vspace="4" alt="[WinVNC tray icon]"><br><font size="-1"><i>New client connections<br>are
        disabled</i></font></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>
    Right-clicking on the tray icon will bring up a menu with the following options on it:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Properties</b> - This will cause the Properties dialog to be displayed, allowing
      the user to change various WinVNC parameters. This dialog will also be displayed on
      double-clicking the tray icon.</li>
    <li><b>Add New Client</b> - This allows outgoing connections to be made from the server
      to any viewer started in the &quot;listening&quot; mode. The name of the target viewer
      machine and optional display number can be entered in the dialog. Connections created
      this way are treated as shared. Such so called &quot;reverse connections&quot; can also
      be initiated from the command line using the <tt>-connect</tt> option.</li>
    <li><b>Kill All Clients</b> - This will disconnect all currently connected clients from
      the server.</li>
    <li><b>Disable New Clients</b> - This will disable new client connection to the server,
      and a red border will appear around the WinVNC icon. Choose the same menu item to
      re-enable new client connections.
    <li><b>About WinVNC</b> - Show the &quot;About...&quot; box.</li>
    <li><b>Close</b> - Shutdown the server.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Most of the options found in the Properties dialog are documented in the <a
    href="http://www.realvnc.com/products/free/3.3.7/winvnc.html">official VNC documentation</a>. 
    In TightVNC Properties dialog, you can find an additional &quot;Advanced&quot; button. Unlike
    the standard VNC, TightVNC allows you to set a number of advanced settings directly from the
    WinVNC GUI, and to apply changed settings immediately. There is no need to launch regedit to
    set query options, connection priority, allow loopback connections, or disable the HTTP
    server etc.
  </p>
  <a name="start_view"></a>
  <h4><font color="#007000">Running a Viewer</font></h4>
  <p>
    To view and control a remote desktop where a TightVNC server is running, you need to run
    the TightVNC viewer. Choose one of the following shortcuts under
    <b>Start-&gt;Programs-&gt;TightVNC</b> to run the viewer:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>TightVNC Viewer (Best Compression)</b> - Use this shortcut if your network
      connection to the server is slow, e.g. in the case of 56Kbps modem connection. This
      will enable Tight encoding with JPEG compression at the lowest image quality,
      consuming minimum of the bandwidth available. Note that you can edit the shortcut to
      tune the compression and JPEG quality levels.</li>
    <li><b>TightVNC Viewer (Fast Compression)</b> - This shortcut is more suitable for
      high-speed networks, e.g. when using TightVNC over a 10Mbit or 100Mbit LAN.</li>
    <li><b>TightVNC Viewer (Listen Mode)</b> - This starts the viewer in the listen
      mode. The viewer's icon will appear in the system tray, and it will accept
      reverse connections from TightVNC servers (see above the description of the WinVNC
      &quot;Add New Client&quot; menu item). The rest of this document does not cover the
      listen mode.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    After you have started the viewer, you will be prompted for the host name and optional
    display number of the remote server you want to access. The display number typically will
    be :0 if the remote server is WinVNC and you did not change its default settings. If
    there was no display number entered, the viewer assumes it to be :0. After entering the
    host name and the display number, click OK, and you will be prompted for your password,
    after which you should see the remote display. If the machine running the server does not
    have a proper DNS entry, you probably won't be able to use the computer name and
    will have to type in its IP address. (Note that the TightVNC server displays the IP
    address when the mouse is passing over its tray icon.)
  </p>
  <a name="start_java"></a>
  <h4><font color="#007000">Using a Web Browser as a Viewer</font></h4>
  <p>
    The VNC servers also contain a small Web server. If you connect to it with a web browser,
    the Java version of the viewer will be downloaded automatically, allowing you to access
    the remote desktop. Obviously, your Web browser must support Java applets. Also, you
    should not use a proxy, to let the Java applet access the remote server directly.
  </p>
  <p>
    The server listens for HTTP connections on port 5800 + display number. (Remember a WinVNC
    machine defaults to the display 0.) So to connect to the display 2 on machine
    &quot;myhost&quot;, you would point your web browser at: http://myhost:5802/ . The applet
    will prompt you for your password, and should then display the desktop.
  </p>
  <a name="uninst"></a>
  <h3>Uninstalling TightVNC</h3>
  <p>
    TightVNC can be uninstalled using the Add/Remove Programs utility under the Control
    Panel, but it's also ok to remove the directory you have installed it into
    (typically, <tt>C:\Program Files\TightVNC</tt>). Note that the TightVNC installation
    program does not copy any files into the system directory. Before uninstalling TightVNC,
    make sure WinVNC is not running and not installed as a service.
